# Mock Interview — Feature Reference

## Overview

The mock interview system lets users practise under real interview conditions: a countdown timer, no mid-session solutions, and a post-session debrief. It is accessible to all authenticated users at `/mock` (requires login).

## Session Modes

| Mode | Time limit | Questions |
|---|---|---|
| Quick | 30 min | 2 |
| Full | 60 min | 3 |
| Custom | 10–90 min (user-set) | 1–5 (user-set) |

Custom mode validates server-side: `num_questions` must be 1–5, `time_minutes` must be 10–90.

## Tracks and Difficulties

**Tracks:** SQL, Python, Pandas, PySpark, Mixed (draws from all four)

**Difficulties:** Easy, Medium, Hard, Mixed (blend)

## Plan-based Access Gates

| Feature | Free | Pro | Elite / Lifetime Elite |
|---|---|---|---|
| Easy mocks | ✅ Unlimited | ✅ Unlimited | ✅ Unlimited |
| Medium mocks | ✅ Unlimited easy · **1 medium/day** (requires medium unlocked in practice first) | ✅ Unlimited | ✅ Unlimited |
| Hard mocks | ❌ Plan-locked (upgrade to Pro) | ✅ **3 hard/day** | ✅ Unlimited |
| Mixed mocks | ✅ (restricted to unlocked difficulties) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Company-filtered mocks | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (SQL track only) |
| Weak-spot insights in summary | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

**Pre-flight access check:** `GET /api/mock/access?track=<track>` is called every time the track selector changes. It returns per-difficulty `can_start`, `daily_limit`, `daily_used`, `needs_upgrade`, and `block_copy` so the UI can render gate state without a round-trip on Start.

---

## Company Filter (Elite only)

Elite users see a **Company** dropdown when the SQL track is selected. Selecting a company sends `company_filter: "Meta"` (etc.) in the start payload. The backend validates that the user has Elite tier before allowing the session to proceed.

Available companies: Airbnb, Amazon, Amplitude, Databricks, Google, LinkedIn, Meta, Microsoft, Netflix, PayPal, Salesforce, Shopify, Snowflake, Stripe, Zendesk, eBay.

## Active Session (`/mock/:id`)

- **Countdown timer** in the topbar — colour-coded: normal → amber (<10 min) → red (<3 min). Browser tab title updates with remaining time.
- **Auto-finish** when timer reaches 0.
- **Question navigation** — numbered dot tabs, each shows solved/unsolved state.
- **Run code** — SQL, Python, and Pandas support running code against the live evaluator mid-session (same as practice mode). PySpark is MCQ-only.
- **SQL schema viewer** — Description / Schema toggle in the left panel.
- **Hints and concept tags** visible on each question.
- **Submit per question** — returns correct/incorrect + feedback immediately. **No solution revealed mid-session** (verified by API; solutions are withheld from the `/submit` response).
- **Exit confirmation** — clicking Exit or End Session shows a confirm dialog.
- **Session reload recovery** — navigating back to `/mock/:id` restores state from the server. Remaining time is recomputed from `started_at`.
- **Mobile** — collapsible left panel for the question description.

## Post-session Summary

Shown after `POST /api/mock/:id/finish`:

- **Score headline** — `X/Y correct`.
- **(Elite)** Baseline comparison — `X% above/below your session average` pulled from `/api/dashboard/insights`.
- **Time used** — `MM:SS used of MM:SS limit`.
- **Per-question breakdown** — solved/unsolved badge, time spent, expandable **"See solution"** toggle (reference solution + explanation, revealed only after finish).
- **(Elite) Concept accuracy table** — lists every concept that appeared in the session with `correct / attempted`, sorted worst-first.
- **(Elite) "Drill weak concepts →"** — links to `/practice/:track?concepts=...` pre-filtered to the worst 2 concepts from the session.
- **Share result** — copies a summary string to clipboard.

---

## History (`/mock` page)

- Shows the last 20 sessions in a table: Date, Mode, Track, Difficulty, Score (X/Y), Time limit.
- **Review →** for completed sessions, **Resume →** for in-progress ones.
- Empty state links to practice tracks and the dashboard.

## How to Use (the `?` button on /mock)

1. **Choose mode** — Quick (30 min, 2 questions), Full (60 min, 3 questions), or Custom.
2. **Pick track and difficulty** — Difficulty buttons show live access state (remaining daily sessions or upgrade CTAs).
3. **(Elite, SQL track)** Optionally select a **Company** filter.
4. **Start** — the timer starts immediately.
5. **During the session** — write your answer in the editor, run it to check, and submit each question. No solutions are shown yet.
6. **End session** — click "End session" or let the timer run out.
7. **Review** — see your score, solutions to every question, and (Elite) your concept weak-spots with a drill link.
